# Microwave Oven System

This project is an implementation of a simple microwave oven system, designed as part of a software Test course. The system is built using C# and follows a modular architecture, with separate modules for handling user input, controlling the microwave oven's hardware components (such as the power tube and light), and displaying information to the user.

# Features

### The Microwave Oven System includes the following features:

1. Cooking functionality:
Users can set a cooking time and power level, and start the microwave oven to cook their food.
2. User interface:
The system has a simple interface with a numeric keypad for inputting cooking time and power level, and a display to show relevant information.
3. Hardware control: 
The system can control the power tube and light of the microwave oven, as well as detect when the oven door is open or closed.
4. Buzzer/beeper:
A hardware sound buzzer will be added to the system, which is used at the end of the cooking period to signal the user with 3 short bursts of buzzing sounds.
5. Configurable power tube power:
The power tube power is no longer hard-coded to 700 W; instead, it can be configured to other values (e.g. 500 W, 800 W, 1000 W) from the main function.
6. Extend cooking time:
Users can press a button during cooking to add an amount of seconds to the remaining time, prolonging the cooking period. If the function makes the time go to 0, the oven stops immediately.
7. Second button (optional):
The system supports an additional button that can be used to add seconds to the cooking time more precisely.
* Progressive time steps (optional):
Pressing the time button progresses from 5 s, to 10 s, to 30 s, to 1 min, etc. with progressively larger jumps according to a pattern chosen by the developers.
